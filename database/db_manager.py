Database Manager for Scientific Literature Intelligence System

This module demonstrates enterprise-level database management patterns
commonly tested in technical interviews at data-focused companies.

Key Interview Concepts Demonstrated:
1. Connection pooling and resource management
2. Transaction handling and ACID properties  
3. Database migration patterns
4. Performance monitoring and query optimization
5. Error handling and logging best practices
